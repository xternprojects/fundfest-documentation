    >We have to start locking down standardized terminology for certain features within the applications.
    
    >Fundfest is not a permenant name, if you come up with a better one, feel free to share.
    
    >The Fundfest Management Team is looking for someone to help with branding/graphic design.


## More In Depth

### > We Have Our First Major Deadline!
We must have something to show off by September 1st. The Orr Fellowship has a lot of money($500,000 over 4 years, or $125,000 a year), that they are giving out to a project that helps to "build Indy"(or something like that, it sounds like they have pretty loose rules around that money), but they have to decide what they are doing with it .  We will discuss what this means at the next development meeting.
    
### > Look vs Functionality
With our new deadline, web needs to focus on look over functionality so that the website looks good for the presentation. Functionality should not be ignored, but it can take the backseat for now until this project gets funded.
